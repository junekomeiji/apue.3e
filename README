This repository has taken several years off my life span. After spending a whole
day searching down random Stack Exchange questions, as well as fiddling around 
with gcc and the code itself, I have finally gotten it to compile. I haven't
tested anything in the repository yet, though I will soon.

This repository solely exists to prevent myself from accidentally deleting all 
my work on accident, and I make no guarantees on how well this repository of
arcane UNIX functions will run on your system.

May God be with you.
